 * Per-workflow "yes-always" consent store.

 * The user can answer `yes-always` on the workflow permission dialog;
 * we then remember that choice in `<claudeConfigHomeDir>/workflow-consents.json`
 * so future invocations of the same workflow skip the dialog and return
 * `{ behavior: 'allow' }` directly.
 *
 * The file shape is a flat `{ [workflowName]: true | false }` map —
 * `true` = user previously answered yes-always, `false` = user previously
 * answered no (so the next run still goes through the dialog but the
 * dialog can default to "no" if it wants; we keep the entry as a soft
 * signal rather than hard-blocking). Reading the file tolerates a
 * missing/corrupt JSON: missing → empty map, JSON.parse throws → empty
 * map. This keeps the runtime code free of try/catch ladders at every
 * call site.
