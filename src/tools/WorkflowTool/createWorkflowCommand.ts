 * Convert a loaded Workflow into a `type: 'prompt'` Command object so

 * because that helper takes a `filePath` and derives everything from
 * basename — useful for the future "register without loading" path, but
 * not a fit here where the registry has already loaded the Workflow and
 * knows its real description (or has explicitly marked it absent).

 * command (list/manage runs in this session) is NOT returned here —
 * it's a separate `local-jsx` command registered through the standard

 *
 * Bundled workflows (e.g. /deep-research) are filtered out because
 * they have their own registration path via `registerBundled()` and
 * are surfaced through the WorkflowTool itself, not as slash commands.
 *
 * Kept in WorkflowTool/ (not commands/workflows/) so commands.ts can lazy-load
 * it the same way it lazy-loads other plugin/built-in command groups —
 * this lets the rest of the command resolution path stay synchronous while
 * the workflow runtime (worker threads, scheduler) is loaded on demand.
