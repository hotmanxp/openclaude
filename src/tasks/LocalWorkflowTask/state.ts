 * - `script`: the JS source being executed (set by start())
 * - `agents`: per-spawn-subagent UI state (one entry per spawnSubagent() call)
 * - `currentPhase`: title of the most recently announced phase (from \`phase()\`)
 * - `meta`: workflow metadata declared via \`__setMeta()\` at script start
 * - `result` / `error` / `totalCostUsd`: run outputs
