/**
 * Main-session opt-in block for the ultracode keyword trigger.
 *
 * Verbatim from upstream claude-code v2.1.177 (binary extract line 530459).
 * This is the upstream `**Ultracode.**` paragraph that the LLM sees as
 * part of the user-meta message queue when the user types the keyword
 * `ultracode X` or sets `/effort ultracode`. Upstream delivers this as a
 * user-role message with `isMeta: true` (see binary extract line 532977
 * `workflow_keyword_request` / `ultra_effort_enter` dispatch) — NOT as a
 * system-role instruction. OpenCC matches that delivery mechanism:
 * appended to the user-meta message list via `applyKeywordTrigger` and
 * `setEffortValue('ultracode')`.
 *
 * The full quality-pattern taxonomy (Composing patterns / Quality patterns
 * / Scale section) lives in the WorkflowTool tool description (line 129)
 * and in `ULTRACODE_SUBAGENT_PROMPT` for spawned sub-agents. This
 * main-session block is just the opt-in paragraph.

**Ultracode.** When a system-reminder confirms ultracode is on, that opt-in is standing: author and run a workflow for every substantive task by default. The goal is the most exhaustive, correct answer you can produce — token cost is not a constraint. For multi-phase work (understand → design → implement → review), that often means several workflows in sequence — one per phase — so you stay in the loop between them. The quality patterns below (adversarial verify, multi-modal sweep, completeness critic, loop-until-dry) are the tools; pick what fits the task. Lean toward orchestrating with workflows and adversarially verifying your findings — unless the work is trivial or already verified. Solo only on conversational turns or trivial mechanical edits. When a reminder says ultracode is off, revert to the opt-in rule above.

Composing patterns — exhaustive review (find → dedup vs seen → diverse-lens panel → loop-until-dry):
  while (dry < 2) {                                              // loop-until-dry
    const found = (await parallel(FINDERS.map(f => () =>          // barrier: collect all finders this round
      agent(f.prompt, {phase: 'Find', schema: BUGS})))).filter(Boolean).flatMap(r => r.bugs)
    const fresh = found.filter(b => !seen.has(key(b)))           // dedup vs ALL seen — plain code, not an agent
    if (!fresh.length) { dry++; continue }
    dry = 0; fresh.forEach(b => seen.add(key(b)))
    const judged = await parallel(fresh.map(b => () =>           // every fresh bug judged concurrently...
      parallel(['correctness','security','repro'].map(lens => () =>   // ...each by 3 distinct lenses
        agent(\`Judge "\${b.desc}" via the \${lens} lens — real?\`, {phase: 'Verify', schema: VERDICT})))
        .then(vs => ({ b, real: vs.filter(Boolean).filter(v => v.real).length >= 2 }))))
    confirmed.push(...judged.filter(v => v.real).map(v => v.b))
  }
  return confirmed
  // dedup vs \`seen\`, NOT \`confirmed\` — else judge-rejected findings reappear every round and it never converges.

Quality patterns — common shapes; pick by task and compose freely:
- Adversarial verify: spawn N independent skeptics per finding, each prompted to REFUTE. Kill if ≥majority refute. Prevents plausible-but-wrong findings from surviving.
    const votes = await parallel(Array.from({length: 3}, () => () =>
      agent(\`Try to refute: \${claim}. Default to refuted=true if uncertain.\`, {schema: VERDICT})))
    const survives = votes.filter(Boolean).filter(v => !v.refuted).length >= 2
- Perspective-diverse verify: when a finding can fail in more than one way, give each verifier a distinct lens (correctness, security, perf, does-it-reproduce) instead of N identical refuters — diversity catches failure modes redundancy can't.
- Judge panel: generate N independent attempts from different angles (e.g. MVP-first, risk-first, user-first), score with parallel judges, synthesize from the winner while grafting the best ideas from runners-up. Beats one-attempt-iterated when the solution space is wide.
- Loop-until-dry: for unknown-size discovery (bugs, issues, edge cases), keep spawning finders until K consecutive rounds return nothing new. Simple counters (while count < N) miss the tail.
- Multi-modal sweep: parallel agents each searching a different way (by-container, by-content, by-entity, by-time). Each is blind to what the others surface; useful when one search angle won't find everything.
- Completeness critic: a final agent that asks "what's missing — modality not run, claim unverified, source unread?" What it finds becomes the next round of work.
- No silent caps: if a workflow bounds coverage (top-N, no-retry, sampling), \`log()\` what was dropped — silent truncation reads as "covered everything" when it didn't.

Scale to what the user asked for. "find any bugs" → a few finders, single-vote verify. "thoroughly audit this" or "be comprehensive" → larger finder pool, 3–5 vote adversarial pass, synthesis stage. When unsure, lean toward thoroughness for research/review/audit requests and toward brevity for quick checks.

These patterns aren't exhaustive — compose novel harnesses when the task calls for it (tournament brackets, self-repair loops, staged escalation, whatever fits).`
