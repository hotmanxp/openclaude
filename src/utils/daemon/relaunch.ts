/**
 * Bg daemon — `--bg` CLI flag + AGENT_VIEW_RELAUNCH_ENV_KEY relaunch
 * marker (T10 of bg-agent-view plan).
 *
 * Two pieces:
 *
 * 1. `relaunchToJob(short)` — set the relaunch env var to `short`, then
 *    re-exec the current process (`process.execPath` + `process.argv.slice(1)`)
 *    with the inherited env. The child process sees the env var on startup
 *    and can branch into the bg-attach path (T9 BackgroundAgentViewDialog
 *    focused on that job).
 *
 * 2. `isRelaunch()` / `getRelaunchShort()` / `clearRelaunchMarker()` —
 *    read/clear helpers used at startup to detect that the current
 *    process is a relaunch child. The short id is validated against the
 *    `JOB_SHORT_RE` (8 lowercase hex chars) regex.
 *
 * The env key name `AGENT_VIEW_RELAUNCH_ENV_KEY` is part of the
 * cross-process contract — it's how an existing terminal session is
 * "captured" into the agent view by upstream 2.1.177. Drift from the
 * upstream string breaks compatibility with users who scripted around
 * the documented constant.
 *
 * The `attach` op itself (col/rows/attachId) is dispatched from the
 * child process in a follow-up task; this module only handles the
 * env-var + re-exec seam.
 *
 * @see docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-13-plan-bg-agent-view.md §T10

/**
 * Startup entry point for the relaunch child process. Call this from
 * `src/entrypoints/cli.tsx` early in `main()`: if the env var is set
 * and valid, dispatch the `attach` op and return the parsed short so
 * the caller can render the BackgroundAgentViewDialog focused on it.
 *
 * Returns `null` when this process is not a relaunch (env var unset
 * or invalid). The caller should treat `null` as "fall through to
 * normal CLI startup".
 *
 * The `cols` / `rows` defaults (80x24) are upstream defaults for the
 * TUI fallback when no PTY size is available. Callers that know the
 * actual TTY size (e.g. Ink's `useStdout`) can pass it in.
 *
 * NOTE: the IPC `attach` op lives in the daemon supervisor (T5); the
 * relaunch child receives the response and the TUI rendering is
 * BackgroundAgentViewDialog (T9). This function only owns the
 * "is this a relaunch?" check + parameter validation; the actual
 * dispatch + render is left to the caller. Wiring T10 → T5 + T9 is a
 * follow-up commit (T11 smoke will exercise it).
